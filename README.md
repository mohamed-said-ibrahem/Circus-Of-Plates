# Circus-Of-Plates
It's game using Java UI.The objective of this game is to collect three plates or more in the clownâ€™s plates to increase the player score, it is also a multiplayer game The game also supports save and load using serialization The game was built using different Design Patterns. 
# Tasks
#### 1- You should not support only plates; you should support other shapes (you should have a class Shape). The shapes classes should be dynamically loaded at the start of the execution from a specific folder. You should support at least two shapes.

#### 2- The user gets a point when he collects three consecutive shapes from the same color (even if they are different shapes).

#### 3- You should use (at least) the following ten patterns in your design:

(Singleton, Factory or Pool, Iterator, Dynamic Linkage, Snapshot, State, Strategy, Observer, MVC, Object Pool).

#### 4- Complete log of the operations done on the game (e.g., user actions, objects intersections, creation or reusing of objects) should be generated. You must use log4J package for this purpose. The Log4J Open Source package could be used for that purpose. Logging all such actions will introduce a delay to the game, so you must use multiple level of logging (e.g. DEBUG, INFO, .....), and classify your logs according its nature.
